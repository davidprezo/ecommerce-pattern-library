  The regular buttons are used for lighter backgrounds. I also generally will take half the page until the screen becomes smaller. Buttons and images will be closer to each other for the sake of keeping things compact.

  The light buttons are used for darker backgrounds.

  The ghost buttons are used on top of images.
